# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/project-1-responive-layout-with-html5-and-c-n2BNGprt6v).

## 📋 Overview

### The Challenge
A simple component to practice the absolute basics of HTML and CSS. The goal was to match the design as closely as possible and ensure responsiveness.

## 🏗️ My Process

### Built With
- **Semantic HTML5**
- **CSS Custom Properties** (Variables)
- **Flexbox** (For perfect centering)
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I Learned
I used this project to master the "Perfect Center." By applying Flexbox to the `body` and setting a minimum height, the component stays centered regardless of the screen size.
